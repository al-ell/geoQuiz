## Design

### Colour Scheme

![color scheme](/assets/docs/styling/ColorPallete.png)
careated using [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) color pallete generator.

I have attempted to make the website gender neutral. I chose a yellow backing for the majority of the quiz as it is easier to read.

### Typography

I have chosen child friendly and easy to read Google Fonts for the logo, headings/movie titles and paragraphs.
